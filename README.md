### **Abstract**
This study examines the impact of hand hygiene practices on mortality rates within medical clinics. By analyzing historical data, this research aims to quantify the effect of handwashing implementation on patient outcomes. The findings provide statistical evidence supporting the role of sanitation in reducing infection-related fatalities.

### **Introduction**
The significance of hygiene in medical settings has been widely documented, with historical accounts attributing a substantial decrease in mortality to the introduction of handwashing. This analysis seeks to empirically validate these claims using historical clinical data, comparing mortality rates before and after the implementation of hand hygiene practices.

### **Data and Methodology**
#### **1. Data Sources**
The study employs two datasets:
- **Yearly Data:** Records annual births and deaths per clinic.
- **Monthly Data:** Provides a more granular view of births and deaths recorded per month.

The handwashing protocol was introduced on **June 1, 1847**, and serves as the intervention point for comparison.

#### **2. Analytical Approach**
Key statistical techniques applied in this study include:
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculation of mortality rates before and after the intervention.
- **t-Test:** Assessment of statistical significance in mortality rate changes.
- **Linear Regression Analysis:** Estimation of the effect size of handwashing on mortality.
- **Cohen’s d:** Measurement of the magnitude of the observed effect.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Determination of the relationship between handwashing and mortality reduction.



### **Results**
#### **1. Mortality Proportion Before and After Handwashing**
| Handwashing Implemented | Mean Mortality Rate (%) |
|------------------------|-----------------------|
| **No** | **10.5** |
| **Yes** | **2.1** |

Following the introduction of handwashing, mortality rates decreased significantly from **10.5% to 2.1%**, underscoring the effectiveness of hygiene practices.

#### **2. Statistical Tests and Findings**
- **t-Test Results:** A Welch Two-Sample t-test reveals a statistically significant difference between pre- and post-intervention mortality rates (p-value = **1.445e-15**), confirming a robust effect.
- **Regression Analysis:** The linear regression model estimates a **8.4% reduction** in mortality attributed to handwashing (p-value = **2.99e-07**), indicating a strong association.
- **Effect Size (Cohen’s d):** A value of **-1.334** denotes a **large effect size**, reinforcing the substantial impact of handwashing practices on patient outcomes.
- **Correlation Coefficient:** The negative correlation between handwashing and mortality further substantiates the protective role of sanitation measures.

### **Discussion**
The empirical evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that handwashing significantly reduces mortality in clinical settings. The statistical significance and large effect size highlight the necessity of rigorous hygiene protocols to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases. These findings align with contemporary medical knowledge, reinforcing the importance of hand hygiene as a fundamental public health measure.

### **Conclusion**
The introduction of hand hygiene practices in 1847 led to a **statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in mortality rates**. This study contributes to the broader discourse on the role of sanitation in healthcare, emphasizing the continued relevance of historical lessons in modern medical practice. Future research should explore additional determinants influencing patient survival rates beyond hygiene interventions.
